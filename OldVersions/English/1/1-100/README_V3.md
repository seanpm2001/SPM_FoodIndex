## About

See above. This is a personal project that indexes what I can eat and drink, showcases opinions, showcases my diet, lists info on my diet, lists my experience, my views, and more. It is not designed for public usage.

***

## History

This food index has been an active project of mine since 2018. It has been rewritten once, and it is still going. It is a project that isn't updated very frequently.

### Google Sites

My food index was originally made on Google Sites ("New" Google Sites) which was bloated, hard to navigate, limited, and not fully owned by me. Since Google Takeout lets you take out classic site data, but not new site data, I have been unable to download my website. I have attempted various siteripping techniques, none have been successful yet.

In response to this, and my Degoogling era that started in 2019, I began to rewrite the project from the ground up, although it isn't close to the same.

[The Google Sites version will go here once I gain access to it](/GSites/)

### Rewritten

I rewrote the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in late 2019/early 2020, and it later got uploaded to GitHub during my transition. It is still updated here, but not very often, as I don't have enough resources to improve the project in the way I need.

## Docs

[Located at /NewDocs/](/NewDocs/)

This folder contains additional documentation that is outside the index of food and drink. It also contains extra opinions and reviews.

***

## Diet

I currently have a strict 2^7-2^8 vegetarian diet (128-256 different things I can eat and drink)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
