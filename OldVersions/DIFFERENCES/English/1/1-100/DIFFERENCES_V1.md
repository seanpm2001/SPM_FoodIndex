# Differences between the Google Sites version and the GitHub rewrite

The original version of this project was written in the "new" Google Sites, less than a year before I started degoogling. Since Google Takeout does not let you download from the "New" Google Sites (but it lets you download from the classic sites) I can't download my original website. I have tried many methods, such as httrack and Google Takeout, but neither worked correctly.

In 2020, I needed this data separate for health reasons, so I completely rewrote it from the ground up. Since then, I have started to learn to use wget, I am yet to test the downloading of the website again.

This rewrite keeps all the data from the Google Sites version, but also is maintained, and gets updates (the Google Sites version was discontinued in 2018 and is out of date)

## Benefits

### Google Sites edition

* Data can easily be accessed and navigated without download

### HTML rewrite

* Data is more up to date

* No bloated Google code is used

* Website can be used offline

* Completely open source

* Contains better data

* Is still maintained

* Is public, and can be accessed by everyone

## Disadvantages

### Google Sites edition

* Is no longer maintained

* Is extremely bloated

* Is owned by Google

* Will be deleted in the future

* Is proprietary

* Is out of date (over 3 years out of date)

* Is private, and can only be accessed by certain people

### HTML rewrite

* CSS and JS from the Google Sites edition was not recreated, bare HTML was used instead. As such, all background textures, text centering and correct header sizes is currently missing

* Currently can't be easily accessed directly as a website
