### February 2021 issue report

I have reviewed the functionality of the site today, and noted many things that need to be fixed. I see that this project was a bit rushed when I made it, I built it in less than 12 hours, so that's probably why.

When I get to fixing it, here are the things that need to be fixed:

* Sidebar icon is broken

* Most image links are broken

* Many page links are broken

* Might need a white background option, due to the images with white backgrounds (slightly ambiguous, as I have still not yet figured out how to make buttons that change the page interface)

* Entry: spaghetti-Os needs to be removed, as it is no longer eaten at the moment

* Google sites mode interface option (ambiguous project) - will convert the site from basic HTML that can run on nearly any web browser to a recreation of the original Google Sites version, which will require Linux kernel 2.3/3.11 and up, Windows XP and up, MacOS X 10.0 and up, etc. Requires massive HTML, CSS, JS and graphical rewrite, estimated development time: ~80-200 hours. This will disclude all Google and tracking code.
