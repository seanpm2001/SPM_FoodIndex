# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and its security issues should also be mentioned elsewhere in the seanpm2001 community. For here, report issues with the security label. DO NOT REPORT ZERO DAY VULNERABILITIES PUBLICLY.

Security vulnerabilities shouldn't be too common here, but they may/will still happen.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)
