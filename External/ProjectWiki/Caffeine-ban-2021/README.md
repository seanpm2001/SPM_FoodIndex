# Caffeine ban 2021

Caffeine is like a drug. It has chemicals that can get you hooked. I had to stop drinking Caffeine completely in mid-January 2021, as I already got an addiction and suffered severe performance problems 3 times within less than a month. Each time it became a problem, I stopped drinking it. I had to repeat this 3 times until I got it under control. As of February 11th 2021, I still haven't drank anything with caffeine since.

Notable drinks I stopped drinking include:

* Mountain dew

* Diet Pepsi
