# Nutritionist

## May 27th 2021

The appointment went well, but with not much change. The supplemental options I was given are:

* Terras Whey

* Centrum (vitamin) with water

* Zevia in Smootjhies

* protein

* water (hydration)

* Hybiscus tea

> *  Pitcher + in fridge

I don't know if these suggestions will work. As of June 11th 2021, we have not tried any of them
It was nice to see the Santa Maria again. The nutritionist was nice, but I was hard of focus and these solutions weren't too helpful to me.

I was really hesistant on writing this entry, holding off doing so until Friday, June 11th 2021.
