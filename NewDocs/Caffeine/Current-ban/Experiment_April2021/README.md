# Caffeine experiment April 2021

I did an experiment with Caffeine in early April 2021, as I was so out of it that day. It didn't seem to help with problems, and was only a placebo. It caused the following problems:

- [x] Mood problems

- [x] Overactive bladder

- [x] Focus issues

I tried this for 2 days, and it just got worse (day 1: 1 can of mountain dew, day 2: 2 cans of mountain dew) I have decided to permanently take myself off of caffeine, and reinforce the ban into a much higher level (the level of drinking alcohol, where not a single drop can come within 12 inches of my mouth)
