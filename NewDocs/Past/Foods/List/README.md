# Past foods

This has been private for a while, as I forgot about it. Recently with my common cold, my hunger came back. I have remembered older data as well.

This is a list of past foods I have eaten, but don't/can't eat anymore:

## Listing

1. Pepperoni Pizza

2. Peas

3. McDonald's hash browns

4. Burger King chicken nuggets

5. Chicken and Stars soup

6. Chef Boyardee Ravioli

7. Chicken noodle soup

8. Iceburg toasted cheese sandwich

9. Dairy Queen Chicken strips

10. Dairy Queen French toast

11. Cheetos (curly) (no longer manufactured, since ~2011)

12. Barbecue pringles

13. Jack-in-the-box chicken nuggets

This list may be updated again in the future.
