# Wendys in Walla Walla

This may be a stupid request, but it is a common conversation piece that comes up from time to time when I talk about food. Walla Walla needs a Wendys restaurant again.

Walla Walla used to have a Wendys, but despite its popularity, it was replaced over a decade ago with a failing restaurant that has been closed for 2 years now (as of 2021 October 22nd) it is an abandoned building now.

Wendys is one of the few restaurants I can eat at, despite only 2 items being edible to me (3 if you count drinks) I feel like other people would benefit from it too.

I can't have it very often at the moment, as the nearest city that you can get it at is in Tri-Cities, which is over an hour and a half away (by car)
