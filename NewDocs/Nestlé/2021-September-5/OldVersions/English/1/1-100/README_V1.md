# The situation with Nestle

I have been boycotting Nestle for months. I have recently learned of an additional sector of food that I didn't originally know they produced, which is over 4 different types of cereal that I eat. I would list the image (2021 September 5th) but I reached the 25 project limit. I have already cut too much out of my diet, and am suffering horribly due to it. There is only 1 solution left: **NESTLE *MUST* BE BROKEN UP** it has been far too long that they have been doing bad things. They are also the only major problem with Switzerland, and it would make Switzerland a much better place if they went out of business.

Nestle is clearly an out of control malicious monopoly, it has been known for decades, but the movement against them only started to gain massive traction in the past decade. Nestle being broken up doesn't mean that all the brands they produce for need to be destroyed, they just need to be given to various smaller companies not affiliated with or owned by Nestle.

Nestle has a history of large scale human rights violations, such as manipulating poorer countries into using baby powder over natural breastfeeding, then cutting off the supply, hurting a generation of life badly. Most notably, they are known for their unethical practices of stealing water facilities from various countries around the world and in the United States all the while proclaiming that water is not a human right.

Nestle has had a horrible impact on my life, they are one of the major reasons why I don't drink water, because their crap has always tasted bad and is what probably ruined water for me. (how can I live without drinking water? I get water from various sources, just not directly)

In all means, [fuck Nestle](https://www.reddit.com/r/fucknestle/).
