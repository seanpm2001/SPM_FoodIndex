# Going Nestle free

I am now working on going Nestle free, as the Vegetarianism idea worked, and now I need to fix this issue.

As of May 5th 2021, I have stopped consuming Nestle products, starting with chocolate milk mix. I just drink milk plain now, or have Darigold instead (note: Dairy Gold should really make their own chocolate milk mix if they haven't already, it would make it a lot easier for people to switch from Nestle, and many could switch unknowningly)

I am also cutting other Nestle products, starting with KitKats. If I find any other "treats" by Nestle that are on my list, I am going to cut them quickly.
